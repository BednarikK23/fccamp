- **Project Structure:** Explore the organization of the project, including directories and files that correspond to different sections of the tutorial.


I really loved this tutorial, but I fell in love even more with the beautiful Go language, I really liked the concept of keyword defer, the syntax of this language and the really simple way of parallel programming. Even the interfaces and "methods" in Go really intrigued me, how well they are architectured.
