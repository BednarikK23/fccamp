// so normally what would you do would be push mystring directory into github and import it from there
// what we are doing here with replace and require?:
// little hack to get things working locally without hoving to pubvblish to git...
// we re saying: I want you to take this string, this path (github/...)
// and dont goo look for it on the internet instead just resolve it on this path ../mystrings
