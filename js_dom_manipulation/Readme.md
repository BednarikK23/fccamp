Surprizingly I enjoyed thi tutorial although
I hated JS, now I am becomming to enjoy it 
and I see myself doing more work in JS. 
I wanna try more tutorials on JS, like JS + AI
or games in JS. also wanna try some webpages.
But firstly I have to do some things first, 
Calculus, Algebra, Go lang, C#, C++ and maxbe GPU programming - CUDA..
